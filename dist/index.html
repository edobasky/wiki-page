  <p>The <b>Internet</b> (or <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalization_of_Internet" target="_blank">internet</a></b>) is the global system of interconnected <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network" target="_blank">computer networks</a> that uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite" target="_blank">Internet protocol suite</a> (TCP/IP) to communicate between networks and devices. It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext" target="_blank">hypertext<a> documents and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application" target="_blank">applications</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web" target="_blank">World Wide Web</a> (WWW), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email" target="_blank">electronic mail</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_over_IP"target="_blank">telephony</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_sharing" target="_blank">file sharing</a>.
</p>
 <p>The origins of the Internet date back to the development of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_switching" target="_blank">packet switching<a/> and research commissioned by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense" target="_blank">United States Department of Defense</a> in the 1960s to enable time-sharing of computers.<sup><a href="#ref1" id="jump1">[1]</a></sup> The primary precursor network, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET" target="_blank">ARPANET<a/>, initially served as a backbone for interconnection of regional academic and military networks in the 1970s. The funding of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Science_Foundation_Network" target="_blank">National Science Foundation Network</a> as a new backbone in the 1980s, as well as private funding for other commercial extensions, led to worldwide participation in the development of new networking technologies, and the merger of many networks.<sup><a href="#ref2
   " id="jump2">[2]</a></sup> The linking of commercial networks and enterprises by the early 1990s marked the beginning of the transition to the modern Internet,<sup><a href="#ref3" id="jump3">[3]</a></sup> and generated a sustained exponential growth as generations of institutional, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer" target="_blank">personal</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device" target="_blank">mobile</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer" target="_blank">computers</a> were connected to the network. Although the Internet was widely used by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academia">academia</a> in the 1980s, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercialization_of_the_Internet" target="_blank">commercialization</a> incorporated its services and technologies into virtually every aspect of modern life.

      <p>The word internetted was used as early as 1849, meaning interconnected or interwoven.<sup><a href="#ref4">[7]</a></sup> Today, the term Internet most commonly refers to the global system of interconnected computer networks, though it may also refer to any group of smaller networks. When it came into common use, most publications treated the word as a capitalized proper noun; this has become less common.<sup><a href="#ref5">[8]</a></sup> This reflects the tendency in English to capitalize new terms and move to lowercase as they become familiar.[8][9] It is sometimes still capitalized to distinguish the global internet from smaller networks, though many publications, including the AP Stylebook, recommend the lowercase form in every case.<sup><a href="#ref5">[8]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref6">[9]</a></sup> In 2016, the Oxford English Dictionary found that, based on a study of around 2.5 billion printed and online sources, "Internet" was capitalized in 54% of cases.<sup><a href="#ref7">[10]</sup></a></p>

      <p>The communications infrastructure of the Internet consists of its hardware components and a system of software layers that control various aspects of the architecture. As with any computer network, the Internet physically consists of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(computing)" targe="_blank">routers</a>, media (such as cabling and radio links), repeaters, modems etc. However, as an example of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internetworking" target="_blank">internetworking</a>, many of the network nodes are not necessarily internet equipment per se, the internet packets are carried by other full-fledged networking protocols with the Internet acting as a homogeneous networking standard, running across <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterogeneous" targe="_blank">heterogeneous</a> hardware, with the packets guided to their destinations by IP routers.</p>

      <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_provider" target="_blank">Internet service providers</a> (ISPs) establish the worldwide connectivity between individual networks at various levels of scope. End-users who only access the Internet when needed to perform a function or obtain information, represent the bottom of the routing hierarchy</p>
      <b><p id="access">Access</p></b>
      <p>Common methods of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_access" target="_blank">Internet access</a> by users include dial-up with a computer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modem" target="_blank">modem</a> via telephone circuits, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadband_Internet_access" target="_blank">broadband</a> over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coaxial_cable" target="_blank">coaxial cable</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber" target="_blank">fiber optics</a> or copper wires, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi" target="_blank">Wi-Fi</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_Internet" target="_blank">satellite</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_telephony" target="_blank">cellular telephone</a> technology (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3G" target="_blank">3G</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4G" target="_blank">4G</a>).
